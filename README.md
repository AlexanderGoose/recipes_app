# Recipe Management System
### By: Alexander Gustafson

### Project Description
This project aims to create a simple, user-friendly recipe management system that is as simple to use as possible. No fancy features or other gimmicks, it's just recipes. 

### Plans for future versions:
- **Edit Recipes:** Update existing recipes to include new ingredients or adjust instructions.
- **Search Functionality:** Enable users to quickly find recipes using keywords, tags, or categories.
- **Deployment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk:** Make the system accessible from anywhere by hosting it securely on AWS.


### General instructions to run:
- **Create a venv environment:** 'python -m venv venv'
- **Activate it:** 'source venv/bin/activate'
- **Download dependencies:** 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
- **Run the flask application:** 'flask --app app.py run'

### Motivations
This project was created with the intention of expanding on my knowledge of flask and sql. By working on this application, I aim to gain practical experience in web development and backend database management while building a useful tool that others can benefit from.
